## Refund Request Automation
**an IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation entry point**

***

**Business Challenge:** Customer demand is volatile ... requiring the ability to quickly scale up or down

**Entry Point:** Handle spikes in demand with straight-through processing

**Use Case Overview:** Imagine that a customer purchases your product, but is unfortunately unsatisfied and requests a refund. Today, your refund process has several manual steps. Managing high volumes of refunds that require manual investigation leads to slow average completion times, inconsistent status updates to customers, and higher costs for any errors made.
This use case demonstrates the use of automation in the form of straight-through-processing to save time, money, and customer frustration.

**Trial Details:** If you have a Digital Business Automation on Cloud trial, your environment is predeployed, continue to the Guided Tour section within the [Refund request use case](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-dba/use-cases/refund-req/)].

### Environment

We assume the following products are installed, up and running:

* IBM Cloud PakÂ® for Automation version 20.0.3
    * Business Automation Workflow (BAW) on VMs
    * Operational Decision Manager (ODM) on OpenShift
    * Business Automation Insights (BAI) on OpenShift (Optional, can be run without)

### Deploy the artifacts

1. Determine your credentials
    1. For BAW, use your own credentials to login to Workflow Center and Process Portal
    1. For ODM, create a service credential/account or use your own basic auth credentials to login to Rule Execution Server console
    1. For BAI, set your password as required by your platform and login to Kibana
1. Deploy ODM artifacts
    1. Login to Decision Center Business console
    1. On Library, click the import icon
    1. Choose and upload Refund Processing [main].zip
    1. Open the main branch, click Deployments and deploy to your Rule Execution Server (adjust the server within the deployment configuration as required)
    1. Return to the branch list and click the plus sign to create a new branch based on main named Reduce Manual Processing
    1. Import Refund Processing [Reduce Manual Processing].zip to the new branch and choose to replace the existing elements
    1. Deploy the new branch as a second version
1. (Optional) Deploy BAI artifacts
    1. Login to Kibana
    1. Management -> Saved Objects -> Import -> RefundRequest YYYY.MM.DD_XX.ndjson
1. Deploy BAW artifacts
    1. Login to Workflow Center and navigate to Process Apps

    1. Open the Refund Request process app and navigate to Process App Settings -> Servers
    1. Edit the settings for hostname, port, authentication and so forth for your ODM server
    1. (Optional) Open the BAI Generators team and add an appropriate user to the team
    1. Go back to Workflow Center and create a new snapshot of the process application
    1. Install the new snapshot to your Workflow Server unless you wish to run directly on Workflow Center's playback server (to support the optional BAI events, make sure the BAW server running the process app has BAI emitters enabled)
1. (Optional) Setup BAI data
    1. Login to Process Portal with the user specified in the above BAI Generators team
    1. Under Launch, click Generate Week 1 BAI Data RR and wait for the spinner to complete in about 20 seconds
    1. Do the same for Generate Week 2 BAI Data RR
    1. Login to Kibana
    1. Management -> Index Patterns -> process-sum* -> refresh icon
    1. Open the Dashboard -> Refund Request (RR) - Week 1 and Week 2 and check that data is displayed.  If it is not, check your emitters are sending data and connected to the BAW server where the Process App is deployed.
